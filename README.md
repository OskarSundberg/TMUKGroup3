# The Plan

We are going to make a chat-service hosted either locally or remotely. It is going to be a chatroom
service with several features such as a general chatroom for clients connected to the server and direct 
messaging from client to client over the server. All messages are going to be encrypted which makes our 
chat-service secure. We are going to create a GUI in WPF which is connected to the code-behind client 
files. 

## Language

We will use C#

## Build System

Not yet decided.

## Compiling and running instructions

Open the server project in Visual studio and start by pressing F5.

Then run the Client project in Visual studio and start by pressing F5.

Now type in the Client window to chat.
