# The Plan

We are going to make a chat-service hosted either locally or remotely. It is going to be a chatroom
service with several features such as a general chatroom for clients connected to the server and direct 
messaging from client to client over the server. All messages are going to be encrypted which makes our 
chat-service secure. We are going to create a GUI in WPF which is connected to the code-behind client 
files. 

## Language

We will use C#

## Build System

We will use .NET in CLI as the build system

## Compiling and running instructions

First make sure you have the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed  

Open ...\TMUKGroup3\Server\Server as current directory in CLI

Input 

     dotnet build

     dotnet run

Now the server is started! Time to start a client

Open ...\TMUKGroup3\Client\ClientPresentation as current directory in CLI

Input 

     dotnet build

     dotnet run

Now you have a working Client.
